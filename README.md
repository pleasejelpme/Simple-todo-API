## General Info

This project is a simple to do API developed with Django Rest Framework as a practice for me
to introduce myself into the development of APIs with DRF.

It has a User Authentication funcionality implemented with JWT, and the ability, for the authenticated
users, to make the basic CRUD funcionalities.

## Tecnologies Used

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/)
- [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org)
- [Simple JWT for DRF](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
